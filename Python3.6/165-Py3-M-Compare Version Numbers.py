Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.

The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision 
of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be 0. For example, 
version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3 and 4 for its first and second level revision number. 
Its third and fourth level revision number are both 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
Example 2:

Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
Output: -1
Example 4:

Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”
Example 5:

Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, 
which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
 

Note:

Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots . and this numeric strings may have leading zeroes.
Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.
版本是用.进行分割的，那么我们也只能通过用.进行分割来判定版本号的大小。把版本号进行分割，
需要找出一个较长的版本号的长度，把较短的版本的后面用0进行补齐。然后进行比较。
