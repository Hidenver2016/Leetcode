Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and 
implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() 
at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

Example:

Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1,2,3].

Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2. 
You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. 
Calling hasNext() after that should return false.
Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?
这道题让我们实现一个顶端迭代器，在普通的迭代器类Iterator的基础上增加了peek的功能，就是返回查看下一个值的功能，但是不移动指针，next()函数才会移动指针，
